You have a list of cities: . To visit the city, you must spend hours in the city. You also have a list of bidirectional
connections between the cities and the respective travel times (in hours) that it will take to travel between each pair
of connected cities.

You and your friends live in the city of Bevagna. You want to plan an itinerary in such a way that you visit the maximum
possible number of cities while satisfying the following rules:

You start your journey in Bevagna on Monday at AM and leave the last city on Sunday morning at AM (at the latest) in
order to return to Bevagna (do not take travel time home at the end of your trip into consideration).
You go to sleep at midnight (i.e., AM) and wake up at AM every day.
You only sleep in a city you're already in, so there is no sleep mid-travel.
You cannot visit the same city twice.
You must be awake to visit a city, so sleeping time does not count toward elapsed visit time.
You cannot leave a city or complete your journey without spending the full hours there. This means that you must finish
visiting the last city before ending your journey.

Given the city and travel route lists described above, create a travel itinerary that maximizes the number of cities
visited during the allotted time specified above. Then print your itinerary as a list of city names in the order in
which you will need to visit them. It's guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of cities in the list.
Each line of the subsequent lines describes a city in the form of two comma-separated values, (the city name) and (the
minimum amount of time you must spend visiting it).
The next line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of connections.
Each of the subsequent lines describes a bidirectional connection between two cities in the form of three
comma-separated values. The first two values are strings, and , describing a bidirectional connection between cities and
; the third value is an integer, , describing the number of hours needed to travel between the two cities.

Constraints

Each city name consists of English alphabetic characters, spaces, and underscores.
Each city name contains a maximum of characters.

Output Format

Print your itinerary as a list of city names in the order in which you plan to visit them. Each city name must be
printed on a new line; if there is no solution satisfying the criteria above, print NONE instead.

Sample Input

Bevagna,Roma,14
Bevagna,Perugia,1
Roma,Florence,4
Roma,Perugia,2

Sample Output

Perugia
Roma
Florence

Explanation

Bevagna is connected to Rome and Perugia, but Perugia is closer and quicker to visit, so we select Perugia first to help
maximize the number of cities in our itinerary.

From Perugia, the only new (i.e., not already visited) connected city is Roma, so we select Roma second.

From Roma, the only city we can visit within the remaining time without violating the rules (as Perugia was already
visited) is Florence, so we select Florence third.
