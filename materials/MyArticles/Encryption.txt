1. how to store password in database?

if you have to store password in database, never store it in clear text, not encrypted by symmetric algorithms such as 3DES
store in hashed after salted.

randomly generates salt for each password, store salt somewhere else but still associated with password. salt can be encrypted
by 3DES or AES. hash(original password+salt) is what stored in database.

2.
hash is one-way computation. the result could not be reversed back to original value.

3.
AES: advanced encryption standard. replacing DES usually. is also symmetric-key algorithm. key size could be 128, 192, 256 bits
