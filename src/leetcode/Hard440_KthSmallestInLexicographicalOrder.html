<p>Actually this is a denary tree (each node has 10 children). Find the kth element is to do a k steps preorder traverse of the tree.<br>

<p>Initially, image you are at node 1 (variable: curr),<br>
    the goal is move (k - 1) steps to the target node x.  (substract steps from k after moving)<br>
    when k is down to 0, curr will be finally at node x, there you get the result.</p>
<p>we don't really need to do a exact k steps preorder traverse of the denary tree, <strong>the idea is to calculate the steps between curr and curr + 1 (neighbor nodes in same level), in order to skip some unnecessary moves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Main function</strong><br>
    Firstly, calculate how many steps curr need to move to curr + 1.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>if the steps &lt;= k, we know we can move to curr + 1, and narrow down k to k - steps.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>else if the steps &gt; k, that means the curr + 1 is actually behind the target node x in the preorder path, we can't  jump to curr + 1. What we have to do is to move forward only 1 step (curr * 10 is always next preorder node) and repeat the iteration.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>calSteps function</strong></p>

        <p>how to calculate the steps between curr and curr + 1?<br>
            Here we come up a idea to calculate by level.<br>
            Let n1 = curr, n2 = curr + 1.<br>
            n2 is always the next right node beside n1's right most node (who shares the same ancestor "curr")<br>
            (refer to the pic, 2 is right next to 1, 20 is right next to 19, 200 is right next to 199).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>so, if n2 &lt;= n, what means n1's right most node exists, we can simply add the number of nodes from n1 to n2 to steps.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>else if n2 &gt; n, what means n (the biggest node) is on the path between n1 to n2, add (n + 1 - n1) to  steps.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>organize this flow to "steps += Math.min(n + 1, n2) - n1; n1 *= 10; n2 *= 10;"</p>
    </li>
</ol>
