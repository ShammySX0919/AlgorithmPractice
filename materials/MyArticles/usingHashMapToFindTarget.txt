while processing, keeping the known statistics into hashmap, and then in rest of processing on the fly,
based on some conditions, to find out elements that have been statistics collected.

One example is two sum, we keep each visited element into map as key to value of its index, later, we check
if sum-newElement is equals to elements that have been visited. map provides fast access to find element that have 
been processed.

another example is subarray of sum k. instead of using element value as key, we use running sum up to index as key.
so that later, new running sum - existing running sum would be range sum. there we use new running sum- k to find if
there's a running sum matched in map.

subarray sum of 0 is just one case of sum of k.
