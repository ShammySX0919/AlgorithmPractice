Naive hashing
    using mod operation, hash(x)%n. not scale. when n changes, most of data will be reallocated.
Consistent hashing
    It would be nice if, when a cache machine was added, it took its fair share of objects from
    all the other cache machines. Equally, when a cache machine was removed, it would be nice if
    its objects were shared between the remaining machines. This is exactly what consistent hashing does -
    consistently maps objects to the same cache machine, as far as is possible, at least.

    it evenly distribute cache by using virtual nodes, or replicas.
