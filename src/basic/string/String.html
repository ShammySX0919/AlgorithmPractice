String is backed up by char[], immutable.
    constant time on charAt and substring, since substring is done by reusing same char[] in string
    O(n) on concatenation because it needs to copy two strings into a new string
StringBuilder is backed up by resizable array. mutable
    O(1*) on concatenation(amortized), but O(n) on substring, because it needs to create a new string

Radix: unique numbers of characters in alphabet
    ascii table's radix is 128
    extended ascii is 256
    DNA 's radix is 4 GCTA
    decimal is 10
Key-indexed sort:
    for limited unique number of element set, if element can be naturally mapped to small integers, then count the
    number of keys and rearranged them according to mapped integer and their counts.
