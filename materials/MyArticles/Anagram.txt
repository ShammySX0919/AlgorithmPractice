anagrams are strings with same set of letters and same number of letters on each letter.

to tell if two strings are anagrams, there are at least two methods.

1. sorting characters in string and compare if the sorted strings are the same.
   
   char[] chars = String.toCharArray();Arrays.sort(chars);String sortedString = new String(chars);
   
2. collect statistics of character frequency with Map, then compare the two map to see if they are the same.
   comparing map can be decreasing first string's frequency with second string's statistics.
