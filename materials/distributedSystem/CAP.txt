C consistent
    after writing, it returns correct value in subsequent read. always give correct answer or no answer
A availability
    always ready for support writing and reading, no out of service. always answers but not necessary accurate.
P partition tolerance
    not same as partition in database.

    this actually means communication between different part/node of system.
    some part of system/database can not talk with some other part of system/database

    partition tolerance is an attribute of distributed system/database, that when it happens, it could deal with it
    after communication comes back. for example, to make data consistent after a node is back to life again.

    (In distributed system, different part of system will be guaranteed
    to fail to communicate. such as power shortage on one node, network cable was broken between nodes etc. one part is not able to
    talk with another part of system as normal situation, what happens after communication back again
    )


P is always there and non-negotiable in distributed system, then what leaving you is to either achieve AP or CP.
The ACP intersection is a place nobody lives there. meaning A and C do not co-exist in distributed system (P is distributed system)
